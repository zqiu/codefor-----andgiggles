researched about the arduino
downloaded the IDE

made the structure for the shirt and master code

imported the RFM12B library
	
working on the shirt board
has communication and pin board set up now

added code to read in sensor value
code stores sensor value into payload

wrote structure to send payload and request acknoweledge everyonce in a while
finished shirt board code. I think

Working on the main board
main board now asks user for input on age,sex and heart rate
main board now recieves in sensor values
main board now checks if sensor values are in range

shirtboard now samples vital signs before sending them
